1. Parts Involved, and Some Information About Them:
- [Central processing unit (CPU)](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/what-is-a-cpu-2950255) The CPU is essentially the brain of the computer. It controls all the processes that the computer uses. The two types that dominate the market for CPUs are Intel, and AMD. While in the past Intel was superior, it seems that AMD is catching up. There are several differences between the two types. Typically, Intel offers a bit better processing performance, but at a higher cost. While AMD offers better graphics on their processors while still maintaining decent processor power and at a cheaper price. If gaming is explicitly what you want your computer for, an Intel processor may be what’s best, but if you plan on using your computer for other things as well - 3D modeling, audio engineering, rendering, etc. - AMD processors are more capable of getting the job done.

- Motherboard — aka, mobo or mainboard - This is a cumulation of circuits that interconnect many of the parts of the computer and enable them to function together, including the CPU. The motherboard takes external information, and relays it to other components to connect that information with the CPU and move the information throughout the other components connected to it. For those who are unfamiliar with the [differences between CPUs and motherboards](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/difference-between-the-cpu-motherboard) and would like a more in-depth information. [Pricing for motherboards](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/motherboard-buying-guide,5682.html)
  - [Northbridge and Southbridge](https://asmed.com/comptia-a-southbridge-and-northbridge/) The Northbridge and Southbridge are like information hubs that control information to various other parts on the motherboard, and they are linked together themselves. Basically, it’s like zooming out of the brain and viewing it as the left and right halves and their connection to each other. The link has a useful diagram that shows what parts connect to the North and Southbridge, respectively.
  - [PCIe](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/pcie-definition,5754.html) These are basically slots on your motherboard that allow for additional components like Graphics cards, Wifi cards, and more SSD space to be added to the computer.
	- [BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)](https://www.howtogeek.com/179789/htg-explains-what-is-bios-and-when-should-i-use-it/) This is information in a chip on your motherboard that runs startup/setup information. For instance, that blue screen you can get to before your computer is fully turned on in order to do a system restore, change start-up settings, etc.
	- [SATA](https://techterms.com/definition/sata) In a nutshell, this is an interface on the motherboard that’s used to enable and support fast hard drives.
	- [Network Interface Card (NIC)](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/n/nic.htm) This is also typically on the motherboard now, and connects your computer to the internet.
	- [Universal Serial Bus (USB)](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/u/usb.htm) The long name for the USB ports that come on nearly all computers. The USB ports allow the use of numerous peripheral items to the computer, such as wireless mice and keyboards, microphones, printers, external hard drives, etc. There are different types of USB ports, but most are now either USB 2.0 or 3.0. The difference between them is that 3.0 is faster, supporting speeds of up to 5 gigabits (640 megabytes) per second, while the 2.0 supports speed of 480 megabits (60 megabytes) per second.
	- [Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE)](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/ide.htm) IDEs are more commonly referred to as PATA, or Parallel ATA, and are the predecessor to SATA, or Serial ATA. SATA are more common, and comes built into the motherboard. However, this [link](https://www.diffen.com/difference/IDE_vs_SATA) provides the differences between the IDE (or PATA) and SATA.
  
- [Memory (RAM)](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-ram/) (Helps explain what RAM is) RAM would be considered the short term memory in a computer, standing for Random Access Memory. Basically, this is the place the computer stores any information that might be needed at a moments notice. The information isn’t permanent like a Hard Drive (HDD) or Solid State Drive (SSD), and once the computer turns off, the RAM is cleared - this is why the information stored here is called volatile information. The most common RAM currently is DDR4, which is faster than its predecessors DDR3 and DDR2, typically this is the type that most laptops will come with, and are widely available to purchase for desktops as well.

- Graphics processing unit (GPU) — aka, graphics card, video card - This centers primarily around graphics and is used to render images, videos, 2D and 3D animation, etc. For gaming, this is one of the most important parts of a computer because if your GPU is underwhelming it may not be able to properly display whatever game you’re playing.

- [Storage — SSD and/or HDD](https://www.windowscentral.com/ssd-vs-hdd-which-should-i-have-my-pc) SSD (Solid State Drive) is much faster than its counterpart HDD (Hard Disk Drive), but is also more expensive. The SSD, unlike the HDD has no moving parts which is part of the reason it’s faster, and seen as being more durable because if the computer is hit or laptop is dropped an HDD is more likely to break than an SSD - although either case is still very unlikely. The typical setup for most users is to have a combination of the two which can be found on many computers. For instance, having a 512Gb SSD + 1Tb HDD. This allows for the best of both worlds and at a reduced price than if you were to try to go solely for a large amount of SSD space. With the hybrid setup, the user can store frequently used applications and programs on the SSD while keeping the larger, slower space for the bulk of their other programs on the HDD.

- [Power supply unit (PSU)](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2025425/how-to-pick-the-best-pc-power-supply.html) The power supply is what it sounds like, the part used to run a desktop. Laptops use batteries and have an accompanying charger with them so this only applies to desktops. For many people they just use the power supply that comes with their computer when they get it, but depending on part upgrades you do to the desktop you may need to increase the wattage (amount of power) that’s supplied to the computer. [This website](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) allows the user to put in all the information on their system to calculate a rough estimate of the power required for their computer.

- [System cooling — CPU cooling and chassis airflow](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cooling-buying-guide,6105.html) If your computer overheats it can become very loud and also affect performance. With that in mind, you must determine what cooling system will work best with your computer. Cooling systems are important for the casual user in order to keep noise to a minimum, performance is taken more into consideration for those who wish to [overclock](https://www.pcworld.com/article/198882/overclocking_for_newbies.html) their systems. [Here’s](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpu-coolers,4181.html) a list of good air and liquid cooling systems.

- [Case](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3226748/how-to-buy-pc-case.html) The PC case is more important than just a place to hold the rest of the computer components. Getting the right case means possible sound reduction, heat management, support for cooling systems, sufficient space for the internal components etc. While many users also get cases with RGB lighting and fancy paneling to make it look nice, the most important things to consider are space, sound, and heat.

- [Monitor](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/monitor-buying-guide,5699.html) Monitors are only needed for desktop computers as the laptop comes with a screen. One of the benefits of a desktop is that the monitor size can vary greatly, with some people even using TVs as their computer monitor. Additionally, a user can have more than one monitor linked together for additional usage in order to run multiple programs and view them at the same time. For gaming, many will forego 4K resolution for 1080p and 144hz. 144hz means that the screen is refreshed 144 times/second, 120hz means it’s refreshed 120 times/second. The type of monitor depends on the user, and there are many options to choose from.

- Gaming peripherals (keyboard, mouse, headphones) - These things are more dependent on the user than anything, but good peripherals improve the experience when using the computer. If these things don’t matter to you, then the links aren’t necessary.

- [Operating system, or OS](https://techterms.com/definition/operating_system) This is software that works with the hardware to run your computer - for instance, Windows 10, Linux, OS X or iOS. Typically, for casual use the OS doesn’t matter all that much and can be whatever the user prefers. For gaming, Windows is typically regarded as the best OS, but for programmers and software developers, many use the MAC OS X. The OS is made up of all the files needed to start and run your computer. Since the type of OS changes the interface (like the differences between iOS and Android) different users prefer different OS.

- [Sound Card (optional)](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-sound-card-2618160) Most sound cards now typically are built directly onto the motherboard, known as on-board sound cards. However, additional sound cards can be installed on a desktop PCIe slot to enable superior audio quality over the on-board card. There are USB versions of sound cards that can work with either desktops or laptops as well allowing audio devices like headphones to be plugged into them. For the most part, this isn’t something to worry about for many people when buying a computer as the on-board sound card is usually sufficient.
