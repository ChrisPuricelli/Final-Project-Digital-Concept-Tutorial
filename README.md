## Laptop vs. Desktop and How to Decide Which to Buy
#### Author: Chris Puricelli


  The purpose of the tutorial is to provide basic, summarized information about laptops vs desktops, where each are applicable, and the parts within them. The decision on whether someone should have a laptop or desktop is dependent on the situations they intend to use it. That being said, the goal of this tutorial is to help provide information for making that decision. There will also be short summarized information about different parts within computers to help those that are unfamiliar. At the end, for those wishing to build their own desktop, there will be links and video tutorials to help walk them through the process.

  The point of this tutorial is for it to be a basic introduction and information source to help people figure out if they want to go the laptop or PC route, with that in mind anyone except for very young children could make use of it. It will be designed to help those with minimal to no experience be able to find information all in one place, and for those that are experienced with the information might be able to make use of some of the links at the very least - however itâ€™s mostly intended for the beginner audience.
